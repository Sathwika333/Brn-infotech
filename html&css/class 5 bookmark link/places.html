        The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast
        Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District
        in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of
        his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and
        completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main
        gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added
        subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several
        historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated
        setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons,
        stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders
        and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and
        also from the Central Asia and Iran.
        <em>Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.</em>

        destination on the West Coast of India, and not just because of its

      ISKCON Vaikuntha Hill in Bangalore is the divine destination for a visit
      to Lord Venkateshwara's abode. This stone temple is constructed as per
      traditional Shilpa shastras (designs as mentioned in scriptures) in the
      Dravidian style of architecture. The design and aesthetics, including the
      seven doors to the sanctum, are inspired by the famous Sri Venkateshwara
      Swamy temple in Tirumala. The deity of Lord Srinivasa is nearly the same
      height and has been named Sri Rajadhiraja Govinda, which means He is the
      King of all kings. This project is conceived and executed by the devotees
      of ISKCON Bangalore, in pursuance of Srila Prabhupada's desire to build a
      grand temple like Tirumala, on His 125th birth anniversary. About ISKCON
      Sri Rajadhiraja Govinda temple Sri Rajadhiraja Govinda Temple is
      surrounded by the shrines of Sri Sudarshana Narasimha, Sri Mahalakshmi,
      Sri Lakshmi Narasimha, Bhakta Hanuman, and Sri Garuda. A separate shrine
      has been constructed for Srila Prabhupada, where his Achala Shila Murti, a
      black stone deity, is installed. This has been done for the first time in
      the history of ISKCON.

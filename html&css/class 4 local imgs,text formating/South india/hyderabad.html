      The Charminar (lit.'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad,
      Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of
      Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana. The
      Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top
      floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously
      significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets
      surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented
      tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous
      festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr, as it is
      adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid. The Charminar is
      situated on the east bank of Musi River. To the west lies the Laad
      Bazaar, and to the southwest lies the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid.
      It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the
      official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of
      India.<em> The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu
      words chƒÅr and minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the towers
      are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.</em>

      Gangtok (Sikkimese: [ɡaŋt̪ʰòk]) is a city, municipality, the capital and
      the most populous city of the Indian state of Sikkim and also the
      headquarters of Gangtok District. Gangtok is in the eastern Himalayan
      range, at an elevation of 1,650 m (5,410 ft). The city's population of
      100,000 consists of the three Sikkimese ethnicities the Bhutias, Lepchas,
      Gorkhalis and also plainsmen from other states of India have settled here.
      Within the higher peaks of the Himalayas and with a year-round mild
      temperate climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry.
      Gangtok rose to prominence as a popular Buddhist pilgrimage site after the
      construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling
      Sikkimese Chogyal, Thutob Namgyal, transferred the capital to Gangtok. In
      the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route
      between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in
      British India. After India won its independence from the British Empire in
      1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its
      capital. After Sikkim's merger with India in 1975, Gangtok continued as
      the state capital.

    <p>
      The lake is fed by the Gurudongmar glacier and is a moraine-dammed
      lake. It is located to the north of the Kanchendzonga range, in a high
      plateau area connected with the Tibetan Plateau. It provides one of the
      source streams which joins the Tso Lahmu and then form the source of the
      Teesta River. The lake remains completely frozen in the winter months,
      from November to Mid-May. The lake has an area of 118 hectares (290
      acres) and its peripheral length is 5.34 kilometres (3.32 mi).However,
      the size of the lake appears small at the place where the devotees offer
      worship because the larger part of the lake is not visible due to hilly
      topography obstructing the view. The area surrounding the lake, also
      known as Gurudongmar, is inhabited by yaks, blue sheep and other wildlife
      of high altitude. The lake is fresh water and used to be very clear;
      the bed of the lake could even be seen from the middle of the lake.
      Pollution has muddied the waters in recent years, and the lake has taken
      on a white tinge and has obscured visibility.

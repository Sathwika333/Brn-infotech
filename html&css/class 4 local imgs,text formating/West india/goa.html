      Dudhsagar Falls (lit.'Sea of Milk') is a four-tiered waterfall located on
      the Mandovi River in the Indian state of Goa. It is 60 km from Panaji by
      road and is located on the Belgaum Vasco Da Gama rail route about 46 km
      east of Madgaon and 80 km south of Belgaum. Dudhsagar Falls is amongst
      India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m (1017 feet) and an
      average width of 30 metres (100 feet). The falls are located in the
      Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park among the Western
      Ghats. The falls are a punctuation mark in the journey of the Mandovi
      River from the Western Ghats to Panjim where it meets the Arabian sea. The
      area is surrounded by deciduous forests with rich biodiversity. The falls
      are not particularly spectacular during the dry season but during the
      monsoon season, however, the falls are fed by rains and form a huge force
      of water.

      The Ajanta Caves are 29 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments dating from the
      second century BCE to about 480 CE in the Aurangabad District of
      Maharashtra state in India.Ajanta Caves are a UNESCO World
      Heritage Site. Universally regarded as masterpieces of Buddhist
      religious art, the caves include paintings and rock-cut sculptures
      described as among the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art,
      particularly expressive paintings that present emotions through gesture,
      pose and form.The caves were built in two phases, the first
      starting around the second century BCE and the second occurring from 400
      to 650 CE, according to older accounts, or in a brief period of 460â€“480 CE
      according to later scholarship.The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient
      monasteries (Viharas) and worship-halls (Chaityas) of different Buddhist
      traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock. The caves
      also present paintings depicting the past lives  and rebirths of the
      Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut
      sculptures of Buddhist deities.Textual records suggest that
      these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a resting
      site for merchants and pilgrims in ancient India. While vivid colours
      and mural wall paintings were abundant in Indian history as evidenced by
      historical records, Caves 1, 2, 16 and 17 of Ajanta form the largest
      corpus of surviving ancient Indian wall-paintings.[

      Marine Drive is a 3 kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji Subhash
      Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai, India. The road and promenade were
      constructed by Pallonji Mistry. It is a banana-shaped, six-lane concrete
      road along the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive
      is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road along links Nariman Point at
      southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip. Marine Drive
      is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west. Marine Drive is also
      known as the Queen's Necklace because, when viewed at night from an
      elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a
      string of pearls in a necklace. Marine Drive from Malabar Hills The
      official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash Chandra
      Bose Road. The promenade is lined with palm trees. At the northern end of
      Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach famed for its
      Bhel Puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line this stretch of
      the road. Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighborhood
      of the city, also home to the Governor of Maharashtra. Most of the
      buildings erected by wealthy Parsis were constructed in an art deco style,
      which was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Among the earliest art deco
      buildings on Marine Drive were the Kapur Mahal, Zaver Mahal and Keval
      Mahal, built between 1937 and 1939 for a total cost of 1 million
      rupees.

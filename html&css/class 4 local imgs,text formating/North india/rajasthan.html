      <ins>"The Golden city", is a city in the Indian state of Rajasthan, located 575
      kilometres (357 mi) west of the state capital Jaipur</ins>. It is the
      administrative headquarters of Jaisalmer District. Before Indian
      independence, the town served as the capital of the Jaisalmer State, ruled
      by the Bhati Rajputs. Jaisalmer stands on a ridge of yellowish sandstone
      and is crowned by the ancient Jaisalmer Fort. This fort contains a royal
      palace and several ornate Jain temples. Many of the houses and temples of
      both the fort and of the town below are built of finely sculptured
      sandstone. <em>The town lies in the heart of the Thar Desert (the Great Indian
      Desert) and has a population, including the residents of the fort, of
      about 78,000</em>. The state of Jaisalmer had its foundations in what remains
      of the Empire ruled by the Bhati dynasty. Early Bhati rulers ruled over
      large empire stretching from Ghazni in modern-day Afghanistan to Sialkot,
      Lahore and Rawalpindi in modern-day Pakistan to Bhatinda, Muktsar &
      Hanumangarh in Modern day India. The empire crumbled over time because of
      continuous invasions from the central Asia. According to Satish Chandra,
      the Hindu Shahis of Afghanistan made an alliance with the Bhati rulers of
      Multhan, because they wanted to end the slave raids made by the Turkic
      ruler of Ghazni, however the alliance was defeated by Alp Tigin in 977 CE.
      Bhati dominions continued to be shifted towards the South as they ruled
      Multan, then finally got pushed into Cholistan and Jaisalmer where Rawal
      Devaraja built Dera Rawal / Derawar. Jaisalmer was the new capital founded
      in 1156 by Rawal Jaisal and the state took its name from the capital.

      2011, the city has a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most

      the dominant colour scheme of its buildings and as the Paris of India. C.
      V. Raman called it the Island of Glory. It is located 268 km (167 miles)
      from the national capital New Delhi. Jaipur was founded in 1727 by the
      Kachhwaha Rajput ruler Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amer, after whom
      the city is named. It is one of the earliest planned cities of modern
      India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. During the British Colonial
      period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State. After independence
      in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of
      Rajasthan. Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India and forms a
      part of the west Golden Triangle tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra
      (240 km, 149 mi).<em> It also serves as a gateway to other tourist
      destinations in Rajasthan such as Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Udaipur,
      Kota, Ajmer, and Mount Abu. On 6 July 2019, UNESCO World Heritage
      Committee inscribed Jaipur the "Pink City of India" among its World
      Heritage Sites</em>. The city is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage
      Sites Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar.

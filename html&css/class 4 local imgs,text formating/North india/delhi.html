      <ins>The Taj Mahal is an Islamic religious building, mosque and tomb
        inIndia. It was built in the 17th century by Emperor Shah Jahan in
        memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal</ins>. Its chief architect was Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The building is in the
      city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. It is widely thought as one of the most
      beautiful buildings in the world. It is one of India's biggest tourist
      attractions.<em>The Taj Mahal is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with the 
        Agra Fort, 2.5 kilometers away. It was listed as one of the 7
        Wonders of the World in 2007</em>. It is on the south bank of the Yamuna river in Agra. The building was
      originally white. Because of pollution, it is turning yellow. Sulphur
      dioxide in the atmosphere reacts with water molecules and becomes
      sulphuric acid, which slowly destroys the outer layer of the building. The
      Taj Mahal is one of the most notable examples of Islamic architecture ever
      built. When it was built, most of India was ruled over by the Mughal
      Empire except the South. Shah Jahan was a Mughal emperor who came into
      power around 1628. According to historians, Shah Jahan loved building and
      architecture, which gave him the nickname<em> “The Builder Of Marvels”</em>. 
      The Taj Mahal was built for Shah Jahan's third wife, Mumtaz Mahal-
      meaning the “Jewel of the palace”. She became ill giving birth to their
      14th child. As she was about to die, she asked Shah Jahan to make her the
      most beautiful tomb that was ever built. She died on 17 June 1631. In
      1657, Shah Jahan fell ill. He died in captivity in 1666. His tomb was
      placed besides Mumtaz Mahal's.

      <ins>The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war
        "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Rajpath</ins>. It
         stands as a memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who died
      between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders,
      Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and
      the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names,
      including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are
      inscribed on the gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the
      architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch
      of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often compared to
      the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai. India
      Gate in 1931 under Construction Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in
      1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a reversed
      rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was
      built beneath the archway.<em>This structure, called Amar Jawan Jyoti 
    (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb
     of the unknownsoldier</em>. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and
      every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits the gate to pay their
      tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade
      starts. India Gate is often a location for civil society protests.

    <p style="background-color: brown; color: black;">
      Eeswaran (Siddharth) is a government employee from Palani who bonds with
      his eight-year old niece Sundari (Baby Sahasra) and is always protective
      about her. Eeswaran also has a couple of close friends, one of whom
      happens to be an undercover cop named Vadivelu, whose niece Ponni (Baby
      Aafiya) and Sundari are also good friends. Unable to comprehend her elder
      sister's romantic conversation with her boyfriend, Ponni assumes that a
      bevy of deers is present in a forest area close to the school and asks
      Sundari if she would be interested in going to see the animals after
      school. The two girls plan to leave Eeswaran and head to the area on their
      own. Ponni and Sundari board an auto rikshaw to the area as per the plan,
      but Sundari gets scared and leaves Ponni, who goes alone to see the area.
      The next day, Ponni's father accuses Eeswaran of assaulting Ponni, but
      Vadivelu finds that Eeswaran is innocent and apologizes to him. One day,
      due to ongoing pressure and doubts on him from his Sister-in-law makes
      Eeswaran angrily walk away from home, and Sundari tries to run behind him,
      but gets kidnapped by a notorious pedophile. Eeswaran sets on a crusade to
      save Sundari, where they finally save Sundari and admits her to the
      hospital after being abused by the pedophile. Eeswaran finds that the
      police has captured the culprit, but finds out that the culprit is
      actually Ponni's abuser. Eeswaran still stabs him. Eeswaran's girlfriend
      Shakti (Nimisha Sajayan) shares about her tragic past of being assaulted
      and ask him to forget about his vengeance. Eeswaran agrees and takes care
      of Sundari. A year later, the police find a burnt corpse of the pedophile,
      implying that Eeswaran had learnt about the pedophile's identity and
      killed him.
